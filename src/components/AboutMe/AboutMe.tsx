            Hi! My name is Catherine, and I&quot;m a fullstack web developer with a passion for building interactive and engaging digital experiences. I created this project as a creative take on an OS-style system, allowing me to showcase my skills in both frontend and backend development while having fun experimenting with design, functionality, and user interaction.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            This project is more than just a technical demonstrationâ€”it&quot;s a reflection of my creativity and problem-solving approach. I wanted to craft something unique that blends practicality with a touch of nostalgia, giving users an immersive experience within a browser-based operating system.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            I hope you enjoy exploring this project as much as I enjoyed creating it! Feel free to click around, open windows, and interact with different elements. If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to connect, don&quot;t hesitate to reach out. I&quot;d love to hear your thoughts!
          </p>
